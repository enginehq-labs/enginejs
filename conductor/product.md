# Initial Concept
EngineJS is a Schema-as-Code TypeScript + Express backend framework for building highly reliable and secure systems.

# Product Vision
EngineJS aims to revolutionize backend development by providing a robust framework that simplifies the creation of complex, schema-driven systems. By elevating architecture to code (Schema-as-Code) and ensuring durability through built-in workflow management, EngineJS allows developers to focus on business logic while maintaining strict architectural standards.

# Primary Users
- **Backend Developers:** Building complex, schema-driven applications who need high-level abstractions without sacrificing security or scalability.
- **Enterprise Teams:** Requiring standardized, compliant backend architectures that ensure consistency across large-scale projects.

# Core Features
- **Schema-as-Code DSL:** A robust domain-specific language for defining models, access control lists (ACL), and row-level security (RLS) directly in code.
- **Durable Workflows:** Built-in support for complex workflows utilizing the outbox pattern and retention management to ensure data integrity and reliability.
- **Pluggable Pipelines:** A flexible architecture for creating transforms, validators, and plugins, allowing for highly customizable request processing.

# Goals
- **Rapid Development:** Drastically reduce the time required to build and deploy secure, scalable backends.
- **Reliability & Observability:** Provide a framework where complex business workflows are highly reliable, durable, and easy to observe.
- **Architectural Consistency:** Enforce strict adherence to architectural patterns through a Schema-as-Code approach.

# Success Metrics
- **Development Efficiency:** Measured by the reduction in time-to-market for new backend services.
- **System Stability:** High uptime and 100% durability for managed workflows.
- **Developer Experience:** High levels of developer satisfaction and adoption, evidenced by reduced boilerplate and clear, actionable specifications.

# Challenges & Constraints
- **Performance Abstraction Balance:** Delivering high-level abstractions while maintaining optimal system performance.
- **Legacy Integration:** Ensuring the framework integrates seamlessly with existing legacy databases and external systems.
